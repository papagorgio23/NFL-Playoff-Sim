NFL Playoff Simulation
================

This repository will simulate the 2019 NFL Playoffs.
----------------------------------------------------

##### This is the code from my blog post for [A.I. Sports](https://aisportsfirm.com/predicting-nfl-playoffs/).

1,000,001 simulations takes some time to run. If you lower the num\_sims it will be quicker to play around with on your own.

``` r
set.seed(1234)
while (i <= num_sims) {
  
  ##### Wild Card Weekend
  # AFC
  wc.1.afc <- simulate.game(afc.3, afc.6)
  wc.2.afc <- simulate.game(afc.4, afc.5)
  
  # NFC
  wc.1.nfc <- simulate.game(nfc.3, nfc.6)
  wc.2.nfc <- simulate.game(nfc.4, nfc.5)
  
  ##### Divisional Weekend
  # AFC
  dw.1.afc <- simulate.game(afc.1, wc.2.afc)
  dw.2.afc <- simulate.game(afc.2, wc.1.afc)
  
  # NFC
  dw.1.nfc <- simulate.game(nfc.1, wc.2.nfc)
  dw.2.nfc <- simulate.game(nfc.2, wc.1.nfc)
  
  ##### Championship Weekend
  # AFC
  cw.1.afc <- simulate.game(dw.1.afc, dw.2.afc)
  
  # NFC
  cw.1.nfc <- simulate.game(dw.1.nfc, dw.2.nfc)
  
  ##### Superbowl
  champ <- simulate.game(cw.1.afc, cw.1.nfc)
  
  #print(paste0("This is the winner ",champ))
  
  results.all <- c( 
    i,  
    wc.1.afc,
    wc.2.afc,
    wc.1.nfc,
    wc.2.nfc,
    dw.1.afc,
    dw.2.afc,
    dw.1.nfc,
    dw.2.nfc,
    cw.1.afc,
    cw.1.nfc,
    champ
  )
  
  simulation.results <- c(simulation.results, results.all)
  
  i <- i + 1 
}
```

The Chiefs have the best chance of winning it all!
==================================================

Remember probabilities are just that... probabilities... It doesn't mean that they WILL win. But they have the best chance to win. I love the playoffs! Anything can happen! Let's see how this plays out!

Feel free to play around with the percentages in the "playoff\_games.csv" file to see how it affects the simulation.
